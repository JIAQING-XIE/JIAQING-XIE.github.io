I'm [Jiaqing Xie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tfg7A2AAAAAJ&hl=en), a junior student at the **University of Edinburgh**. 
I'm major in Electronics and Computer Science. Current GPA is 3.98/4.00.
My research interests include graph neural networks, deep generative models(variational inference) and computational biology.

I was supervised by prof. [Manolis Kellis](http://compbio.mit.edu/) from MIT CSAIL lab in the 2020 summer.
For the UG4 project, I'm co-supervised by prof. [Siddharth N.](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/snaraya3/)(University of Edinburgh), postdoc [Tuan Anh Le](https://www.tuananhle.co.uk/)(MIT CSAIL) and [Eli Bingham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0uUoiCIAAAAJ&hl=en)(Pryo leader, Broad Institute).
For the current graph neural network project, I am supervised by phd candidate [Zhitao(Rex) Ying](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rexy/) (Stanford University).
For the current GAN project, I am supervised by my personal tutor [Nick Polydorides](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/nick-polydorides)

I'm looking forward to applying for the phd research program next year. My dream schools are Caltech, MIT and Stanford.
